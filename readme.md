# Gorp - Simple Minecraft CLI tools.

Gorp is a simple jumble of BASH shell scripts to make administering Minecraft servers easier for people who want a dead-simple CLI tool. No faffing about with web panels, Docker, or opening ports. Gorp's main goal is to do the exact same thing you would already do on a simple game server, but make it faster. It's development cycle and feature roadmap is guided entirely by my own usage, but I'm open to suggestions, if anybody's even reading this.

Please refer to this site for documentation and installation instructions:

[Gorp Documentation](https://gorp.lanickel.com/)

Gorp is in beta! While it has been extensively tested and dog-fooded, strange bugs and behaviors are definetely still lurking. You should, regardless of server software, be following the 3-2-1 backup rule.
